## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This is a serverless web application with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React SPA hosted on Vercel (auto-deploys from GitHub)
- **Backend**: Supabase (managed PostgreSQL database, authentication, and file storage)
- **Domain**: bdaypresenter.com (GoDaddy DNS → Vercel)
- **Version Control**: GitHub ([mbyrdLCS/bdaypresenter](https://github.com/mbyrdLCS/bdaypresenter))

### How It Works

1. **User Signs Up** → Creates account in Supabase Auth
2. **Profile Created** → Automatic trigger creates user profile with unique display URL slug
3. **Add Team Members** → Stored in Supabase database with photos in Supabase Storage
4. **Display Page** → Public URL at `/display/{slug}` shows birthdays in real-time
5. **SignPresenter** → Points to the display URL, auto-updates when data changes (no re-configuration needed!)

### Auto-Updates Feature

The beauty of this system: **Set it once in SignPresenter, and changes auto-update!**

- User adds/edits/deletes birthdays in dashboard
- Changes are saved to Supabase database
- Display page fetches fresh data on each load
- SignPresenter shows updated content automatically
- No need to re-add URLs or refresh anything in SignPresenter

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Multi-tenant Authentication** - Each organization has their own account
- 👥 **Team Management** - Add, edit, and delete team members
- 📸 **Photo Uploads** - Upload profile photos for each team member
- 🎨 **Seasonal Themes** - Automatically changing themes for each month
- 📅 **Monthly View** - Shows all birthdays for the current month
- 🎉 **Daily Spotlight** - Full-screen celebration on actual birthdays
- 🔄 **Auto-rotation** - Cycles through multiple birthdays on the same day
- 🔗 **Unique Display URLs** - Each organization gets their own display URL
- 📺 **SignPresenter Ready** - Optimized for digital signage

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase account (free tier works great)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
cd birthday-celebration-app
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

#### Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project"
3. Create a new project (note: it may take 2-3 minutes to set up)

#### Run the Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `database-schema.sql`
3. Paste and run the SQL script
4. This will create:
   - `profiles` table
   - `team_members` table
   - Row Level Security policies
   - Automatic profile creation trigger

#### Set Up Storage

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Click "New bucket"
3. Create a bucket named `profile-photos`
4. Make it **public**
5. Add the following policy for uploads:
   - Policy name: "Authenticated users can upload"
   - Allowed operation: INSERT
   - Target roles: authenticated
   - Policy definition: `(bucket_id = 'profile-photos')`

#### Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Project Settings** → **API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** (looks like `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
3. Copy your **anon/public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 📱 Usage

### For Organizations

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account with your organization name
2. **Add Team Members**: Go to the dashboard and add team members with:
   - Name
   - Birthday (month and day)
   - Photo (optional)
3. **Get Your Display URL**: Copy the unique URL from your dashboard
4. **Set Up SignPresenter**:
   - Add a new website element in SignPresenter
   - Paste your display URL
   - Set the duration as desired (recommended: 30-60 seconds)
   - [SignPresenter Website Guide](https://support.signpresenter.com/topics/showwebsite.html)

### Display Behavior

- **Monthly View**: Shows all birthdays for the current month in a grid layout
- **Birthday Spotlight**: On someone's actual birthday, shows a full-screen celebration with their photo
- **Multiple Birthdays**: If multiple people share a birthday, it rotates between them every 10 seconds
- **Seasonal Themes**: Each month has a unique color scheme and emoji theme

- Vercel URL: https://bdaypresenter.vercel.app
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/mbyrdLCS/bdaypresenter

**Infrastructure:**
- Hosting: Vercel (Free tier - auto-deploys from GitHub main branch)
- Database: Supabase (Free tier - hosted PostgreSQL)

### How to Update the Live Site

**The app uses continuous deployment - it's fully automated!**

1. Make your changes locally
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **That's it!** Vercel automatically:
   - Detects the push to main branch
   - Runs the build (`npm run build`)
   - Deploys to production
   - Updates https://bdaypresenter.com
   - Usually takes 1-2 minutes

## 🔄 Common Updates & Maintenance

### Adding New Features

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Test locally
4. Commit and push:

   git commit -m "Add: your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. Merge to main when ready (or create PR on GitHub)

### Updating Styles/Design

- Main styles: `src/index.css` (Tailwind utilities and custom classes)
- Component styles: Tailwind classes in JSX files
- Color scheme: Edit gradient colors in component files
- Seasonal themes: `src/pages/Display.jsx` (line ~100-200)

### Database Changes

1. Make changes in Supabase dashboard SQL editor
2. Update `database-schema.sql` file to keep it in sync
3. Document changes in this README

### Environment Variables

**Local development:**
- Edit `.env` file
- Restart dev server

**Production (Vercel):**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Select bdaypresenter project
3. Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add/Edit variables
5. Redeploy (or push to trigger auto-deploy)

### Supabase Keep-Alive (Prevent Auto-Pause)

Supabase free tier projects are paused after 7 days of inactivity. To prevent this, we use an external cron service to ping the database daily.

**Endpoint:** `https://bdaypresenter.com/api/keep-alive`

**Setup:**
1. The keep-alive endpoint is at `api/keep-alive.js` - it makes a simple query to keep the database active
2. We use [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) (free) to ping this endpoint daily
3. Login to cron-job.org to view/edit the scheduled job named "Keep Bday alive"

**To modify the cron schedule:**
1. Go to [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) and log in
2. Find the "Keep Bday alive" job
3. Adjust the schedule as needed (currently set to daily at 3:00 AM)

**Note:** Vercel's built-in cron jobs require a Pro plan. That's why we use the free external service instead.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Supabase credentials not found" warning

- Make sure your `.env` file exists and has the correct variables
- Restart your development server after creating/updating `.env`

### Photos not uploading

- Verify you created the `profile-photos` bucket in Supabase Storage
- Ensure the bucket is set to public
- Check that upload policies are configured correctly

### Display page not showing team members

- Verify the database schema was run successfully
- Check that team members were added through the dashboard
- Ensure the correct user ID is in the URL

### Build fails with Tailwind errors

- Make sure `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` exist
- Verify `@import "tailwindcss"` is in `src/index.css`
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again

### Domain not working

- Check DNS settings in GoDaddy
- Verify A record points to 216.198.79.1
- Check Vercel domain configuration
- DNS changes can take up to 48 hours (usually 5-30 minutes)

### Deployment failed on Vercel

- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure environment variables are set
- Verify `package.json` scripts are correct
- Check for TypeScript/ESLint errors

## 📝 Database Schema

See `database-schema.sql` for the complete schema with:
- User profiles with organization names
